# AstroTracker
A star tracker is used to cancel the diurnal motion of the earth to achieve optimal observation of astronomical objects. In this project, a self made barn door tracker is driven by a Raspberry Pi 3 using Python scripts. A simple GUI controls the speed of a 28byj-48 stepper motor which opens a tracker where a DSLR camera is mounted.
